# Exchange-Rates-Spread-Sheet

Just a quick thing i threw together to make getting historical exchange rates easier for my math project. 

Gets historical exchange rates from the European Central Bank and stores them into a spread sheet.

## Usage

py exchangeRates.py \<start date> <end date\> \<base country> \<countries to compare againgst>

example: "py exchangeRates.py 2015-02-21 2015-11-30 USD GBP EUR"

the above example would get the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar, the Great british Pound, and the Euro form Feb 21, 2015 till Nov 30, 2015
